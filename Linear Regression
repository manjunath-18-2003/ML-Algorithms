Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. It models the relationship between dependent and independent variables using a straight line

Basic Idea

We try to fit a line:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑐
y=mx+c

Where:

y → Predicted output (target variable)

x → Input feature

m → Slope (weight)

c → Intercept (bias)

This line is chosen by minimizing the error (difference between predicted and actual values), usually using Least Squares.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Dataset (1 feature)
X = np.array([[1000], [1200], [1400], [1600], [1800]])  # Area
y = np.array([50, 60, 70, 80, 90])  # Price

# Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Coefficient:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Prediction for 1500 sq ft:", model.predict([[1500]]))
