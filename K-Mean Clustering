K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into clusters based on similarity.
It tries to partition the dataset into K distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid)

How K-Means Works (Step-by-Step)

Select a value of K (number of clusters)

Randomly initialize K centroids

Assign each data point to its nearest centroid

Recalculate centroids based on assigned points

Repeat steps 3–4 until centroids stop changing (convergence)


from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [1, 4],
    [1, 0],
    [10, 2],
    [10, 4],
    [10, 0]
])

# Create model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(data)

print("Cluster Centers:", kmeans.cluster_centers_)
print("Labels:", kmeans.labels_)
